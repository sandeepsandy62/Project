Internship Project


This project is broken into three stages

Stage 1 : 
Creating a stacked-line chart keeping 100(number of theses) as the base in a react-based application. 
Data could be stored in a JSON file to be consumed in the front end.

Stage 2 : 
One FastAPI-based API to fetch the data.
Data can be stored in the application layer as JSON. The data could already be manually cleaned up.

==> used the FastAPI to get data from the JSON file and display it on the front end.

Output :

Stage 3 :
The dataset needs to be downloaded and stored in a local MongoDB instead of storing the data in the front-end or application layer.

==>MongoDB was utilised as a database to hold the data, and Axios was used to fetch data from the database and display it on the front end.
In the front end, Chart.js was used to visualise the data.
